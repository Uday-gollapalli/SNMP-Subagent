This assignment deals with the extension of default SNMP agent to cater our needs. There are many ways to extend the agent like using extend directive,using pass_persist directive, using AgentX protocol. 
I choose AgentX method over those two because of its modular nature which you can plug or unplug it at any time and it doesn't interrupt with main agent. 
A sub-agent written using AgentX can be decoupled from default snmp agent and can be run on another host carried over TCP. 

**Configuring the SNMP agent**

Just add the following line to [snmpd.conf]() in the [EXTENDING THE AGENT]() field
 
    agentXSocket    tcp:<ip where subagent runs>:<port>

The configuration to be added to [snmpd.conf]() to run my agent 

    agentXSocket    tcp:localhost:705

**Implementing the Sub agent**

I have implemented the sub agent in Golang.
First step is to install Golang on the server.
 
    sudo curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz

    sudo tar -xvf go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz

    sudo mv go /usr/local

Let's set GOPATH value, which tells Go where to look for its files.

    sudo nano ~/.profile

At the end of the file, add the following lines:

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go

Source the above modified file.

    source ~/.profile

Installing the Prerequisites.

    go get gopkg.in/errgo.v1
    go get github.com/posteo/go-agentx

Building the sub agent.

    go build agentx.go

Running the subagent(agentx daemon).
 
    ./agentx
    
Querying the newly implemented sub agent(Open it in a other terminal).

    $ snmpwalk -Cc -v2c -c public localhost:161 1.3.6.1.4.1.4171.40
    
    iso.3.6.1.4.1.4171.40.1 = INTEGER: 1473761130
    iso.3.6.1.4.1.4171.40.2 = STRING: "70"
    iso.3.6.1.4.1.4171.40.3 = STRING: "234.49999999999997"
    iso.3.6.1.4.1.4171.40.4 = STRING: "6.2"

**Note:** It is not possible to represent y(t) values in counter32 because they are actually floating numbers. There is no such datatype to represent float type in snmp. So i used `octetstring` type.
If you want to change the configuration parameters, Just change the counters.conf file and query the agent.
